# Sachel Git

A simple tool to do git things.

Starting with interactive hunk staging.

I want to fundamentally make a GOOD git GUI that anyone can use that is keyboard driven.

To start, we will use space as the leader key before an action.

for example

space -> g -> s

should open a git status view

I will provide a UI screenshot
